"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>the king was a good king. And he used his army only for good. To protect the weak. But power went to his head... and the force that granted " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>these warriors their unbelievable skills noticed. He then spoke a curse upon them all. For following this evil king knowing he was up to no good. " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>But enough of these ancient fairy tales... Hand me the vials and I will try to craft the third key my friend.<BR><BR>" +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>*As Te'Ar starts to work you notice he casts a spell. After that the pours the potions empty on the ground. But the blood never reaches " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>the ground. Instead it forms twenty balls floating in the air at eye hight. Right next to eachother and right infront of Te'Ar. Whom then " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>starts to wirl his hands around the balls. Making big circles with both his arms around and around the floating blood. As he slowly starts " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>to make smaller and small circles he starts to humm. When he touches the outer balls the vanish. Making his way to the middle each of the " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>floating blood balls dissapear on touch. Once he reached the last ball his hands touch excactly when he touches the last ball. And he stops moving..*<BR><BR> " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>What is this? I seem.. there is no key? What... ah silly me. *ADRUM!* There we go. Here take it. Also take this knife. For the fourth key I will " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>need only a hide of the Beast. Just one of them will be enough. The beast is not on of the easier ones to slay I warn you. But I am sure " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>a mighty one like you will manage. I see strength in your aura my friend. And it seems to be growing. A fine one you will become one day.<BR><BR>" +

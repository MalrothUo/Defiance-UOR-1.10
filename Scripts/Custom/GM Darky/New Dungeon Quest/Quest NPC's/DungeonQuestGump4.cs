"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>*After handing the hide to Te'Ar you notice him spreading it om the floor. He examined the hide closely and picks out five hairs at " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>different locations. Then he peels of a claw that where stuck on the hide. He now binds the hairs around the claw and lays it like that " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>on his outstretched hands. He speaks a few words and then slightly starts to blow over the claw with the hairs. You slowly see the claw " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>changing shape. As soon as Te'Ar is done blowing the claw has transformed into a key.*<BR><BR>" +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>There we go. Give me a second to catch my breath. It is getting harder to make the transformation with each key I do. But just one more to go " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>and then we are done my migthy friend. You have no idea what you allready have achieved and no idea how big the impact shall be once completed. " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>I am quite sure the Bard holds more prisoners and perhaps we can manage to free them all. A lot of family's will finally be reunited. And " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>a lot of souls will finally find their peace. The Bard you say? No he left Silence a few years ago. I saw him leave and he never returned. " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>That is why I have the courage to stand here. Inside the dungeon at the entrance waiting for someone willing to aid me. I am afraid the powers " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>of the Bard would even be able to harm a old ghost like me. Or perhaps he would imprison me aswell. But either way there are no more perils " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>then the current inhabitants of this dungeon. And that seems to be enough... *Smiles*. YOu have done well my friend. Just one " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>more task awaits you and we shall be free at last. Take this bag of gems. Find the Noxious ones. Last I heard they left this dungeon " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>to inhabit other lands. But I am sure their outbreak left a passage to their current home. I wish I could guide you more but it is all I " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>know.<BR><BR>" +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>Oh yes, after slaying one of these beast. Use the gem to capture his essence. Bring me fifty of those and we shall be able to construct the " +
"<BASEFONT COLOR=YELLOW>final key my friend. Goodluck , for the last time." +

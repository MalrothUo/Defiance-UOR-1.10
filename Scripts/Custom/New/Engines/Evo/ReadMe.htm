		<P><STRONG><FONT size="4">Evo Creature System 1.6 Notes, 6/7/05</FONT></STRONG></P>
		<P>This system comes with the Evolution dragon, hiyru and mercenary and allows fast 
			and easy creation of new creatures by simply filling in the details of a set of 
			table like structures, one for each stage in the creature's evolution and 
			copying a small set of template classes and replacing the class names with a 
			newly chosen name. It also allows almost anyone to quickly and easily tune evos 
			created under this framework. Unlike other evolution creatures found on the 
			boards timers are not used, resulting in less server lag. The code is well 
			written and rock solid.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Acknowledgements</STRONG></P>
		<P>This framework is my own design. The idea of the evolution creatures and the 
			shrink system and its features are borrowed from the creative minds of the 
			RunUO forum. I do not know the origin of all of these ideas, however there are 
			a few people whose code I used as a guide to model this system. Most notably 
			are: Ronin GT and Asayre8 for their shrink systems, Raelis for the Evolution 
			Dragon and mating gump,&nbsp;GG521 for the Evolution Hiryu, and Sadoul/Grae for 
			their Evolution Mercenary ideas.&nbsp; Thanks also to Protius73 and bzk90 for 
			their contributions in the forum. Special thanks to Princess Monika for her 
			inspiration.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Features</STRONG></P>
		<UL>
			<LI>
			Easy creation of new evolution creatures (a.k.a. Evos), as well as the 
			associated eggs and dust
			<LI>
			A command (EP) that can be used by players to get the experience points of 
			their Evo
			<LI>
			Easy tuning of deployed Evos, by admins - no programming experience necessary 
			for most changes
			<LI>
			Evos can be configured to always remain "Wonderfully Happy" or, without 
			feeding,&nbsp;allow loyalty to decay&nbsp;like other pets
			<LI>
			Integrated shrink system that works with Evos and any other creature derived 
			from BaseCreature (and BaseMount)
			<LI>
			Shrink system comes with shrink command, pet leash and hitching post items
			<LI>
			Shrinking tools can be configured to require zero or more points of taming. 
			They may also be configured to use charges
			<LI>
			Shrunken pets can optionally show stats, be locked or blessed based on 
			configuration variables
			<LI>
			The shrinking is fast and error free as it uses the same method as the RunUO 
			stable, placing pets on the internal map with IsStabled set to true
			<LI>
			A high hit point low damage&nbsp;Training Elemental comes with the 
			system.&nbsp; The Elemental reflects 10% of the damage done to and can be 
			configured as invulnerable or killable.
			<LI>
			The Evos in this system implement only one timer; the pregnancy timer, 
			resulting in less server lag than many other evolution creature designs
			<LI>
			The Evo system comes with three Evo creatures: Dragon, Hiryu, and Mercenary 
			(mercenary has many spoken commands and can equip a large range of items)
			<LI>
			The system is compatible with RunUO 1.0.0 and requires no changes to the RunUO 
			distro files
			<LI>
				Easy to install and configure.</LI></UL>
		<P><STRONG>Installation</STRONG></P>
		<P>
			This system is not compatible with other shrink systems as the format of 
			shrunken pets my be different that what other systems expect. However, this 
			shrink system will coexist with others allowing you to cut users over to the 
			new shrink system after installation.</P>
		<P>For installation, simply place the EVO directory into your customs directory. 
			All shrink system configuration variables are maintained in ShrinkConfig.cs. 
			&nbsp;Configuration of the Evo creatures is done in your derived classes.</P>
		<P><STRONG>How To Create A New Evo</STRONG></P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
			Make a copy of the Hiryu (if it is to be a mount) or Dragon directory under the 
			EVO directory and rename it to YourClass.
			<LI>
			Rename all of the files, replacing EvoHiryu in each file name with YourClass.
			<LI>
			Inside the YourClass directory, open each file and replace all occurreneces of 
			EvoHiryu to YourClass.
			<LI>
			In YourClass.cs, YourClassDust.cs and YourClassEgg.cs change the respective 
			strings "a hiryu corpse", "hiryu dust", and "a hiryu egg" as appropriate.
			<LI>
		Open YourClassSpec.cs.
		<OL>
			<LI>
			In the constructor of the YourClassSpec class, edit the variable values as you 
			see fit.
			<LI>
				Add or remove YourClassStage<EM>X</EM>
			class definitions, according to how many stages you plan to have, by copying 
			and pasting one of the exisiting definitions.
			<LI>
				Change the assignment of the m_Stages vairable in the YourClassSpec constructor 
				according to the number of stages YourClassStage<EM>X</EM> class definitions 
				you have.</LI></OL>
		<LI>
			Edit the values of the variables in each of the YourClassStage<EM>X</EM> as 
			appropriate for each stage of the creatures evolution. Setting any of the array 
			type variables to null will cause them to not be changed in that stage of the 
			evolution. Damage amount, hits, strength, dexterity and intelligence can be 
			applied relatively or absolutely depending on the value of 
			YourClassSpec.m_AbsoluteStatValues. All of the other variables are applied 
			absolutely.</LI></OL>
		<P><STRONG>Caveats</STRONG></P>
		<P>You may use or modify this system in any way you desire, however I ask that you 
			leave the original headers in the source files if you redistribute the sources 
			in any way.</P>
